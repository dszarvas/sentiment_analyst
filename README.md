# MoodRadar - A Sentiment Analysis Web Application

<img src="static/logo.png" alt="drawing" width="200"/>

MoodRadar is a web application that performs sentiment analysis on text input provided by the user. It analyzes the text and categorizes it into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. Additionally, it provides a history of previous sentiment analysis results.

This project is my solution to the homework task for the [Applied Artifical Inteligence Models in Practice](https://portal.vik.bme.hu/kepzes/targyak/VITMAV78/) class at BME-VIK. For the most part it was generated by [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) from designing the project structure to writing the README.md itself. The only exception is the logo, which was generated by [Bing Image Creator (DALL-E 3)](https://www.bing.com/images/create). The prompting and debugging was provided by myself.
