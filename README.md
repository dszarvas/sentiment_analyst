# MoodRadar - A Sentiment Analysis Web Application

<img src="static/logo.png" alt="drawing" width="200"/>

**MoodRadar** is a web application that performs sentiment analysis on text input provided by the user. It analyzes the text and categorizes it into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. Additionally, it provides a history of previous sentiment analysis results.

This project is my solution to the homework task for the [Applied Artifical Inteligence Models in Practice](https://portal.vik.bme.hu/kepzes/targyak/VITMAV78/) class at BME-VIK. For the most part it was generated by [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) from designing the project structure to writing the README.md itself. The only exception is the logo, which was generated by [Bing Image Creator (DALL-E 3)](https://www.bing.com/images/create). The prompting and debugging was provided by myself.

## Features

- Sentiment analysis of user-provided text.
- History tracking of sentiment analysis results.
- Clearing the sentiment analysis history.

## Technologies Used

- Scikit-learn: A machine learning library for sentiment analysis.
- Flask: A Python web framework for building web applications.
- Flask-SQLAlchemy: Extension for Flask that simplifies database integration.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for styling the application.
- SQLite: A lightweight, serverless database for storing sentiment analysis history.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository. When prompted for your Github password, give a valid *Personal Access Token (PAT)* for your account. (Another possible way is to follow the Github link in your browser and clone with one of the options provided there):

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dszarvas/sentiment_analyst.git
   cd sentiment_analyst
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv .sentiment_venv
   source .sentiment_venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use .sentiment_venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install Dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run the Application:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

The web application will be accessible at http://localhost:5000/.

If you would like to run the Jupyter notebook for yourself, don't forget to run it inside the `.sentiment_venv` Python virtual environment created in step number 2 above.

## Usage
- Visit the application in your web browser.
- Enter text in the input field and click "Analyze" to perform sentiment analysis.
- View the sentiment result and the history of previous analyses on the "History" page.
- Use the "Clear History" button to delete the sentiment analysis history (irreversible action).
